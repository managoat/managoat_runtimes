  @moduledoc """
  The layout table, and the agreement it exists to enforce.

  The interesting tests here are the last two: they walk every runtime and
  check that the HOME the process is given and the HOME its files are written
  under are the same directory. That disagreement is what shipped — opencode
  and gemini ran with `HOME=/tmp` while their system prompts were written to
  `/home/sprite`, so both ran on the CLI's default persona and nothing said
  so.
