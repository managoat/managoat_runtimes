  The guardrail that makes the registry worth more than the comments it
  replaces.

  The load-bearing test is `implemented_by`: every entry names the function
  that carries the workaround, and that function has to exist. Delete a
  workaround without deleting its entry and this fails; leave an entry
  pointing at code that is gone and this fails. Everything else here is
  shape-checking so an entry cannot be added without saying what would delete
  it.
