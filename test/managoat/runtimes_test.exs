  # A runtime module that exists on disk and is *not* loaded, which is what

  #
  # Compiled here rather than reusing a real runtime because reaching this
  # state means purging the module, and purging one of the library's own
  # modules throws away the coverage cover has collected for it — the run
  # then reports a smaller suite than it ran.
