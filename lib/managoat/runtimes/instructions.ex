defmodule Managoat.Runtimes.Instructions do
  @moduledoc """
  Deliver the agent's `system` prompt to the runtime (#848).

  `agents.system` was stored, edited, exported and rendered in every form —
  and never reached a sandbox: the ACP `session/new` / `session/prompt`
  carry `cwd`, `mcpServers` and the user's text, nothing else, and no
  runtime module wrote it anywhere. Every agent ran on its CLI's default
  persona.

  Each runtime reads a user-level instructions file at session start; that
  file is the one place all of them honour without flags, and it survives
  suspend/resume on the sandbox disk. Written at provision and rewritten at
  every reattach, so an edit to the agent's prompt lands on its existing
  computer the next time it wakes. An empty/blank prompt removes nothing and
  writes nothing — the CLI's default stands, as before.

  | runtime  | file                                 |
  |----------|--------------------------------------|
  | claude   | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                |
  | codex    | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`                 |
  | opencode | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`       |
  | gemini   | `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`                |

  `~` is the runtime's own HOME, which is **not** `/home/sprite` for all of
  them — opencode and gemini run with `HOME=/tmp`. This module used to expand
  the table above against a hardcoded `/home/sprite`, so for those two the
  prompt was written where their CLI never looks: they ran on the default
  persona, silently, and the test pinned the wrong path alongside. The paths
  now come from `Managoat.Runtimes.Layout`, which is also where the `HOME`
  export is derived from, so the two cannot disagree again.

  The file carries a short header so a human (or the agent) reading it knows
  where it came from, then the prompt verbatim.
