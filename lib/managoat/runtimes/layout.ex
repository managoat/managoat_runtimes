defmodule Managoat.Runtimes.Layout do
  @moduledoc """
  Where a runtime keeps its files inside a sandbox — one table, derived
  everywhere else.

  Every path Fountain writes for a runtime has the same shape:

      <home>/<config_dir>/<leaf>

  and each runtime module used to restate its own half of that from memory.
  `skills_root/0` derived it correctly; `Managoat.Runtimes.Instructions`
  derived it again with `/home/sprite` hardcoded; `Managoat.Runtimes.Gemini`
  and `Managoat.Runtimes.OpenCode` each named a workspace directory that
  `Managoat.Runtimes.ACP`'s adapter table then named a second time — with a
  comment admitting the mirror.

  That duplication was not merely untidy, it was wrong: opencode and gemini
  run with `HOME=/tmp` (see `home/1`), so their system prompts were being
  written to `/home/sprite/...`, where neither CLI looks. The agent ran on its
  CLI's default persona and nothing reported it. Deriving both the HOME export
  and the instructions path from the same row makes that class of drift
  unrepresentable.

  ## The table

  | runtime  | home           | config_dir        | instructions   |
  |----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
  | claude   | `/home/sprite` | `.claude`         | `CLAUDE.md`    |
  | codex    | `/home/sprite` | `.codex`          | `AGENTS.md`    |
  | gemini   | `/tmp`         | `.gemini`         | `GEMINI.md`    |
  | opencode | `/tmp`         | `.config/opencode`| `AGENTS.md`    |

  This is layout only — where files go, and which on-disk dialect writes
  them. What goes *in* those files (credentials, MCP servers, the agent's
  prompt) stays with the runtime modules, and the imperative bootstrap each
  runtime needs stays in its `prepare_sandbox/3`. See `Managoat.Runtimes`.

  # The sandbox image's own home directory. `/home/sprite` is the convention
  # `Managoat.Sandbox` documents (its `host_path/2` is the identity on the
  # hosted providers and maps this directory on a self-hosted runner), not a
  # host application's setting, so it is fixed here rather than taken as an
  # argument. A runtime whose `home` matches inherits it and exports nothing;
  # one that differs gets an explicit HOME (see `home_env/1`).
