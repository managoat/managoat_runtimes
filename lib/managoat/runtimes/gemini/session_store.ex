defmodule Managoat.Runtimes.Gemini.SessionStore do
  @moduledoc """
  A workaround, registered as `:gemini_session_store_consolidation` in
  `Managoat.Runtimes.Quirks` — which carries the deletion condition and how
  to re-probe it. This whole module goes when gemini-cli#28775 lands.

  Keeps gemini's own chat-session store from erasing the session it is asked to
  load — a workaround for [gemini-cli#28775][], tracked as #659.

  ## What goes wrong without this

  Measured against a live `gemini --acp` on 2026-08-22, versions 0.53.0 through
  0.56.0. `session/load` builds a fresh config on the session id *before*
  looking the session up, which stands up a chat recorder; the recorder's
  new-session branch names its file by **wall-clock minute**
  (`toISOString().slice(0, 16)`) plus the id's first 8 characters, so a load in
  the same minute as the last write computes the *same path*; it appends a
  `$set` carrying only gemini's `<session_context>` bootstrap; and gemini's
  reader treats `$set.messages` as a replacement rather than a merge. The
  emptied file then fails `hasResumableContent`, drops out of `listSessions()`,
  and `findSession` reports `-32603` "No previous sessions found for this
  project" — about a session whose transcript is still on disk, above the line
  that erased it.

  Reproduced end to end: a turn-1 file with three resumable messages had one
  left after a same-minute load, and the load failed.

  ## Why a rename is not enough

  The obvious fix — move the file out of the minute-bucketed path — holds for
  exactly one turn. After every load **two** files carry the same `sessionId`:
  the one we parked and the poisoned one the load just created. Gemini dedupes
  by id keeping the later `lastUpdated`, which is the poisoned one, so turn 3
  fails again.

  So this **consolidates** on every turn instead: keep the file with real
  content, delete the poisoned duplicates, and park the survivor under a
  timestamp the recorder can never produce. Discovery is unaffected — gemini
  scans on the `session-` prefix and the extension, and matches on the
  `sessionId` *inside* the file, never on the name.

  Verified live: five consecutive turns inside one wall-clock minute (the case
  that fails on turn 2 without this), history growing 3 → 5 → 7 → 9 → 11, and
  the agent recalling content planted before the first reload every time.

  ## Lifetime

  Delete this module, `priv/gemini-session-consolidate.js`, and the host's
  end-of-turn `consolidate/2` call when upstream lands. Nothing else depends
  on it.
