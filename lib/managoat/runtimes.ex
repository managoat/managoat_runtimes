defmodule Managoat.Runtimes do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour every runtime (claude/codex/gemini/opencode) implements,
  plus a small dispatcher.

  How a coding agent CLI gets into a sandbox and comes up speaking the Agent
  Client Protocol: which adapter to install and at what version
  (`Managoat.Runtimes.ACP`), where its files go (`Managoat.Runtimes.Layout`),
  the instructions file (`Managoat.Runtimes.Instructions`), the skills tree
  (`Managoat.Runtimes.Skills`), the credential env vars (each runtime's
  `default_env/2`), and the per-runtime workarounds with the condition for
  deleting each (`Managoat.Runtimes.Quirks`). The protocol session itself is
  `Managoat.ACP.Peer`; this library is the **provisioning** half that a peer
  needs to have happened first.

  `build_command/5` has **no implementation left** — gemini was the last
  runtime to build a CLI argv for a turn, and that went when every runtime
  moved onto ACP — so the callback stays optional and a host's legacy spawn
  path is unreachable for any runtime `for_runtime/1` will resolve. It is kept
  rather than deleted because a fifth runtime that cannot speak ACP would
  need it, and because the turn machinery a host builds around it (log
  budget, exit handling) is shared and still exercised through
  `Managoat.Runtimes.Testing.FakeRuntime`.

  What varies between runtimes here falls into three kinds, and only the last
  needs code:

    * **Layout** — where files go. Perfectly regular (`<home>/<config_dir>/…`)
      and now stated once, in `Managoat.Runtimes.Layout`. `skills_root/0`,
      `skills_sh_agent/0`, the instructions path and every workspace directory
      are derived from that table rather than restated per module.
    * **Workarounds** — a defect each runtime carries, with a deletion
      condition. Registered in `Managoat.Runtimes.Quirks`, which names the
      function implementing each one and is guarded by a test, so a workaround
      cannot outlive its defect unnoticed.
    * **Credential delivery** — genuinely irreducible, and two shapes rather
      than four: an env var (claude, gemini, opencode) or a login exec that
      consumes the key on stdin (codex, whose CLI ignores the process env).
      The env var's *name* belongs to the runtime-and-provider pair rather
      than to the provider: a Google key is `GEMINI_API_KEY` for the gemini
      runtime and `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` for opencode, which reaches
      Google through `@ai-sdk/google`. See `c:default_env/2` and
      `c:prepare_sandbox/3`.

  ## Calling the optional callbacks

  Four callbacks are optional and the implementation matrix is genuinely
  sparse, so a host has to guard the call — and the obvious guard is wrong:

      # WRONG: silently no-ops in an escript or a release
      if function_exported?(mod, :default_env, 2), do: mod.default_env(agent, creds), else: []

  `function_exported?/3` answers `false` for a module that is merely **not
  loaded yet**, which is the normal state of any module nobody has called
  under an escript or a release. It has already cost one host a provisioning
  run that reported every stage green and then failed on an authentication
  error, because `Managoat.Runtimes.Claude` was unloaded rather than because
  it was missing `default_env/2` — which it implements, as do all four
  runtimes.

  So dispatch through the functions here instead. They load the module first
  and fall back to the documented no-op:

      env = Managoat.Runtimes.default_env(mod, agent, credentials)   # or []
      :ok = Managoat.Runtimes.write_config(mod, handle, agent)       # or :ok
      :ok = Managoat.Runtimes.prepare_sandbox(mod, handle, agent, env)

  `c:build_command/5` has no default to fall back to; ask
  `implements?/3` and decide.

  @typedoc """
  What a runtime reads from the agent it provisions for.

  A plain map, so the host's own record satisfies it whatever else it
  carries: an Ecto struct, a decoded JSON document, a literal in a test. The
  five keys are the whole surface the library reads, and each is optional
  because every reader treats a missing one as "none":

    * `model` — the canonical `provider/model_id` (`Managoat.Runtimes.Model`);
      `OpenCode.default_env/2` picks the credential from its prefix.
    * `mcp_servers` — the agent's MCP servers in Claude's own config shape
      (`%{name => %{"command" | "args" | "env" | "type" | "url" | "headers"}}`),
      read by `write_config/2` and `Managoat.Runtimes.ACP.mcp_servers/1`.
    * `system` and `name` — the instructions file
      (`Managoat.Runtimes.Instructions`).
    * `runtime` — `Managoat.Runtimes.ACP.enabled?/1` accepts the agent as well
      as the bare runtime string.

  Default env vars for the runtime — typically the inference credential
  for the chosen provider (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

  `inference_credentials` is a map of `%{provider_atom => plaintext_string}`
  the host decrypts for the tenant at conversation start. The keys a runtime
  reads are `:anthropic_api_key`, `:claude_code_oauth_token`,
  `:openai_api_key` and `:gemini_api_key`; providers the user hasn't set are
  simply absent from the map.

  ## Why this cannot be a table

  Three things happen here that layout cannot express, and they are the
  reason this stays a callback rather than another column:

    * **Which provider.** claude, codex and gemini each have one. opencode is
      a front-end for all three, so the variable it needs is a function of
      `agent.model` — `Managoat.Runtimes.Model.provider/1` decides at
      provision time.
    * **Which credential, for one provider.** claude takes either a
      `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (bills a Claude.ai subscription) or an
      `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (metered), never both — exporting both has picked
      the wrong one depending on CLI version. The precedence, and the
      mid-conversation fall back to the API key when an org refuses the OAuth
      token (#655), are provider policy with no analogue on the others.
    * **Whether an env var works at all.** codex 0.118+ does not read
      `OPENAI_API_KEY` at exec time. It reads `~/.codex/auth.json`, which only
      `codex login --with-api-key` writes, so its credential is delivered by
      `prepare_sandbox/3` instead — see there.

  So the shape is two-of-four, not four-of-four: an env var, or a login exec.
  Worth restating whenever a fifth runtime arrives, because "just add a column
  for the variable name" is right up until it is codex.

  Optional, so call it through `default_env/3`, which is the loaded-first
  dispatcher — not through a `function_exported?/3` guard, which no-ops it
  in an escript or a release. See

  the first turn — e.g. codex needs `codex login --with-api-key` to
  persist credentials into `~/.codex/auth.json` since it doesn't read
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the live process env.

  Receives the same `sprite_env` pairs the spawn will use. Implementers
  pull whichever keys they need out of that list. No-op by default.

  ## This is the escape hatch, and it should stay one

  Three runtimes implement it and each does something genuinely imperative —
  a login that consumes a key on stdin, a `bun install`, a `git init`. None
  of those is expressible as data, and an abstraction that swallowed them
  would cost more than the duplication it removed. What *was* data (where the
  workspace lives, what HOME is) has already moved to
  `Managoat.Runtimes.Layout`; what is left here is the residue that has to be
  code.

  Runs after `Managoat.Runtimes.ACP.install/3` and after the host's whole
  provisioning pipeline, so it can assume the adapter is on PATH. Note the
  ordering costs something: if the host has already applied a network policy
  to the sandbox, opencode's `bun install` here needs the npm registry on the
  allowlist of any restricted one. It works today because the default is
  unrestricted.
